{"name":"Lord Lorik's Scheem interpreter","body":"Assignment for lesson 4 of PL101 at http://www.nathansuniversity.com/.\r\n\r\nScheem interpreter plus tests. My flavor of Scheem has the following\r\ndeviations from the 'standard':\r\n\r\n* both the + and * operators are variadic\r\n* the - operator behaves as unary minus receives only one argument\r\n* the following comparison operators are valid: = <> > < >= <=\r\n* there's a modulus operator %\r\n* if takes 1-3 arguments: the first is the expression to evaluate, the 2nd one\r\n  the value to return if true and the last one the value to return if false.\r\n  The last two can be omitted, and if returns #t and #f in replacement,\r\n  respectively.\r\n* supports NIL (converted to null in JavaScript). The support level is quite\r\n  low, of course.","tagline":"","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
