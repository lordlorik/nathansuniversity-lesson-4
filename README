Assignment for lesson 4 (part 1) of PL101 at http://www.nathansuniversity.com/.

Scheem parser interpreter plus tests. My flavor of Scheem has the following
deviations from the standard:

* both the + and * operators are variadic
* the - operator behaves as unary minus receives only one argument
* the following comparison operators are valid: = <> > < >= <=
* there's a modulus operator %
* if takes 1-3 arguments: the first is the expression to evaluate, the 2nd one
  the value to return if true and the last one the value to return if false.
  The last two can be omitted, and if returns #t and #f in replacement,
  respectively.
